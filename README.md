# babel-eslint-test
Simple demo that implements Babel, ESLint and SASS.

# Babel and ESLint

After the download, open the terminal and  navigate to the project directory and run:

`$ npr install`

`$ npr run dev`

This will start up a Babel file watcher and ESLint file watcher, who both watch for channges in the `js/src` directory.

# SASS

To watch for sass files in the `css/src` directory, in a new terminal instance, run:

`$ npm run dev`

Happy coding!
